## Technologies

* React
* Redux
* Javascript
* SCSS


## Notable Features
* Fully responsive
* Login/SignUp page
* User's login info saved to local storage to prevent always having to log in
* User's filter and sort settings saved to local storage as well to prevent having to reconfigure on app load
* User can save tasks in one of the default folders (Inbox, Today, Upcoming) or create a custom project folder
* User can filter and sort tasks based on criteria like priority, due date, creation, date and name
* User can check how many tasks they have completed in total.

## What I Learned
* I can and should use hooks to separate business logic from ui logic
* Route redirecting with react-router-dom is great for the ability to access certain routes only if user is authenticated
* Use folder structure where all files for a specific component are within that folder

## Ideas to implements
* When user gets answer right, they click a pop up box that gives them additional information on the country like unit of currency, random fact, etc.
* Pinterest style notes section where a user can dynamically add, remove or edit notes
